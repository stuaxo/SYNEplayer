SYnchronized NEtwork Player is a simple application that let you start some
video players, a master and some slaves, synchronized over a network using
gst.NetTimeProvider / gst.NetClientClock. The synchronization code is taken
from some examples by Andy Wingo (thanks Andy!). The videos will continue to
play in loop.

The player is a basic decodebin / autovideosink based pipeline, no audio support
is provided but it's easy to add it.

SYNEPlayer is designed to survive the death of one of his component, even if the
master dies, the clients are meant to re-synchronize when it comes up again.
